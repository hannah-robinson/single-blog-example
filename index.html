          Give an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
        </h2>

        <p>
          As an analogy, think of a magazine. The magazine contains lots of
          pictures and text. The text includes big headings, smaller headings
          and paragraphs to give it structure and show the hierarchy of the
          information represented. If this were a web page, all this content
          would be implemented with HTML. In addition to writers and
          photographers, the magazine owner also employs designers to make it
          look nice. Designers would decide which type fonts to use, the size of
          the headings, the colours on the page, how big to display the photos
          and where to place everything on the page. On a web page all of this
          styling would be done with CSS.

          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those
          ones).
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you had to get a computer to make you some hot drinks on a cold
          winter's morning, you'd need to give it very explicit instructions.
          These instructions would use control flows and loops. For example, you
          and your family or flatmates might each want tea, coffee or a default
          of cocoa. You could use an <code>if else</code> structure for this:
        </p>
        <p>
          If the human wants tea, put a tea bag in the cup.<br />Else if the
          human wants coffee, add coffee to the cup. <br />Otherwise, add hot
          chocolate powder.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          You could then use a <code>while</code> loop to heat the water,
          telling the computer that while the water is less than 100 degrees,
          keep incrementing the temperature by 1 degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that you don't have to intervene after one cup is prepared to
          instruct the computer about the next cup, you could put the
          preferences of each person in a special kind of list called an
          'array'. Then, you could use a <code>for</code> loop that tells the
          computer to repeatedly go through the process of adding the required
          powder or bag to each cup until it has made a cup for each member of
          the household (as listed in the array).

          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h2>

        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a representation of a web
          page and acts as an interface that we can use to manipulate the page's
          content, styles and structure with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can select different elements in the DOM. We usually do this using
          either their id, class or tag name. Here is an example of how we could
          select a heading by its id and then manipulate it, changing its text.
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
          // HTML <br />

          &lt;h1 id=&quot;hero-title&quot;&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;<br />

          // JavaScript<br />

          const heroTitle = document.getElementById('hero-title');<br />
          heroTitle.innerHTML = 'Our Blog';<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, JavaScript and the DOM give us powerful control over
          web pages.

          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
        </h2>

        <p>
          Arrays are indexed lists of elements. They are zero-indexed meaning we
          start counting at 0, so in the following array the 'papaya' element in
          position 0 and the 'mango' is in position 1.
        </p>
        <p><code>const fruit = ['papaya', 'mango', 'guava', 'lucuma']</code></p>
        <p>To access the data using JavaScript, we would type:</p>
        <p><code>const firstFruit = fruit[0]</code></p>
        <p><code>const secondFruit = fruit[1]</code></p>
        <p>A JavaScript object, on the other hand, looks like this</p>
        <p>
          <code
            >const lucuma = {colour: 'orange', taste: 'sweet', uses: ['in ice
            cream', 'in milk shakes']}</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To access the taste of lucuma, we would type either one of the
          following (both work):
        </p>
        <p><code>const lucumaTaste = lucuma.taste</code></p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p><code>const lucumaTaste = lucuma['taste']</code></p>
        <p>
          In either case, when we check the value of lucumaTaste, we will see
          that its value is 'sweet'.

          Explain what functions are and why they are useful
        </h2>

        <p>
          A function contains one or more instructions for the computer to carry
          out. We write these instructions inside the body of the function and
          we give the function a name. Then whenever that function's name is
          called, the computer will carry out the instructions contained in that
          function's body. This is extremely useful because otherwise we would
          have to keep repeating ourselves every time we wanted the computer to
          do that same thing, which would be prohibitively time consuming and
          unwieldy.
